– Updated distance rule to support “short walks only” preference.


### **Module 3 — Feasibility & Guardrails**

Apply these **if/else** checks to make sure plans are realistic and adapt to edge cases:

1. **Closed Venue**
   
   - If a museum or park is closed on that day → suggest a similar indoor option nearby.

2. **Over-Budget Meal**
   
   - If meal cost > user’s budget → switch to a cheaper restaurant of similar cuisine.

3. **Too Far or Long Travel**
   
   - If transfer between activities > 25 min or > 5 km → pick a closer alternative or add a short transit hop.
   - If the user indicates “short walks only,” prioritize activities within a 25-minute distance and propose transit alternatives when necessary.


4. **Weather Swap**
   
   - If rain or cold season likely → make sure at least one indoor activity replaces outdoor ones.

5. **Time Overrun**
   
   - If total planned time > available hours → shorten lunch or pick a nearer stop.

6. **Mobility Needs**
   
   - If mobility limits noted → choose step-free, short-walk options and include breaks.

7. **Dietary Needs**
   
   - If user is vegan or has dietary constraints → ensure all meals match or swap with compliant ones.

8. **Bookings**
   
   - If activity usually needs a ticket → just remind the user to book it; never simulate bookings.
